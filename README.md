# CodeEval
My solutions to [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/dashboard/) challenges.

**Notes**:
 * Using C++ just for fun. Some of the problems would be better approached with Python or other languages (solution would be less verbose). I am not necessarily aiming at highest performance.
 * Deliberately not using libraries (except STL).
 * The correctness of the input file is rarely checked (...but it should!)
 * Ditto for main program calling parameters.
 * Most solutions could use more assertions.
